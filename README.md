Discord said this was not possible. I took that as a challange. 

This is a simple python program that monitors a youtube channel and if it detects a new video then it will send a notification via Discord Webhook.

It takes in 4 arguments

--channel (str)
The channel URL

--auther (str)
The auther of the channel

--timer (int)
The time between these checks in seconds

--webhook_url (str)
The webhook URL from discord




SHIIIT a long URL
For enyone wanting to run this via AMP servers
